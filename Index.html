      <p>The term “cryptocurrency” is derived from the encryption technology that is used to secure the network.</p>
      <p>A cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged for goods and services online. Many companies issue their own currencies, often called tokens, and can be traded exclusively for a good or service provided by the company.</p>
      <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks that have a distributed ledger implemented by a separate network of computers based on blockchain technology.</p>
      <p>A defining characteristic of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, which makes them theoretically immune from government interference or manipulation.</p>
